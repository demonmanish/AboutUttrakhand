	<center><h1 style="color:black; background-color:skyblue;">History Of Uttarakhand</h1></center>  
Uttarakhand is a settlement of Kol people, belonging to the community who speak the Munda language. Later on, in the Vedic era, Indo-Aryan tribes emerged from the northern region and joined hands with Kols'.There is also a belief that Pandavas of Mahabharta ventured out in Uttarakhand and it was the most ideal abode for Rishis and Sadhus. The first major dynasty that reigned in the Garhwal and Kumaon region was Kunindas who ruled over there in the 2nd century BC. They were followed by the Naga dynasty (4th century), Katyuri dynasty (7th and 14th century), and so on. While coming to the medieval period, in the 13th century the Garhwal and Kumaon kingdom had settled in the west and east regions of the state respectively. In 1791, the Nepalese Gurkha Empire got victorious over Kumaon, and in 1803 they captured over Garhwal as well.
</p>
<img src="C:\Users\acer\Desktop\manish negi\uttarakhand1.jpg">
<p>Then, there was an Anglo-Nepalese war in 1816 that led to the Garhwali kingdom's re-establishment in Tehri, where the Treaty of Sagauli resulted in the removal of the Kumaon Kingdom entirely.  When India got independence, Tehri's state got merged into the state of Uttar Pradesh with the composition of Garhwal and Kumaon regions in Uttarakhand. For a long time, Uttarakhand Kranti Dal was the reason for its nomination as Uttarakhand, and they began asking for a separate state. In 1994, the demand for those political groups got momentum, which led to the division of the region to the state of Uttar Pradesh from it in 2000. Until 1998, Uttaranchal was the name famous for the country with the suggestion of BJP. But, in 2006, demand to rename the state to Uttarakhand rose, and parliament passed a bill in 2006 only to endow the fulfillment of demand. Finally, December 2006 was the time when Uttarakhand became an independent state of India and began developing keeping intact its rich heritage.

<center><h2 style="color:black; background-color:yellow;">Culture Of Uttarakhand</h2></center>
One of the youngest states of India, Uttarakhand, is majorly a home to the people who follow Hinduism. People also abide by other faiths such as Sikhism, Islam, Christianity, and Buddhism, yet the Hindu population dominates with 82.97 percent of people following it as per the census of 2011. With this distribution, people live in rural and urban areas where handicrafts and organic products contribute to the state's economy. In this beautiful hilly state, NGOs and Government aids lend a hand to the rural people in making homestays, selling organic products as well as articles made by hand. The incredibleness of the state can be witnessed through the fairs and folk dances of the country that are still enjoyed by rural communities.

The prosperous state has a lot to unveil amongst the spectators besides the traditional events and handicrafts too.
